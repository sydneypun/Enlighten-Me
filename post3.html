                    <em>A while ago</em>, I was perusing through Google and I found a library called <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>
                    in which you can create various types of data visualizations.  
                </p>

                <h3> <strong> What is a Word Cloud? </strong> </h3>
                <p>
                    Word cloud is a process in which we statistically analyze which words have the highest frequency.
                    The words with a higher frequency have a larger font size in comparison to the words that 
                    have a lower frequency. In this word cloud, Data Science has the highest frequency. In addition, 
                    stop words have been removed from this word cloud to remove any distractions from the final 
                    result. 
                </p>

                <h3> <strong> What is this Word Cloud about?  </strong> </h3>
                <p> 
                    I found an article on <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/03/inspiring-women-blazing-a-trail-in-the-data-science-world/"> <strong>Analytics Vidhya</strong></a> celebrating
                    the power of women in data science. Women around the world are blazing a trail in the data science world and 
                    what better way to honor some of these women than to make a word cloud about them. 
                    These powerful women are inspiring both women AND men in the world of data science. I also found an article on 
                    <a href="https://blog.galvanize.com/7-women-data-scientists-who-made-a-big-difference/"><strong>Galvanize</strong></a> listing some of the top
                    female trailblazers working in the data science industry.

                    While caring for patients during the war, <strong> Florence Nightingale </strong> witnessed the atrocious conditions at the British military hospital in Turkey. The hospital was chaotic, the mortality rate was high, and records were poorly kept. She decided to use statistical analysis to determine best practices at the hospital, and to save lives. Nightingale’s charts weren’t just filled with numbers. It could be argued that she is the godmother of “infographics.” Her most famous design was the “coxcomb,” which is like a more intricate pie chart. The coxcomb is still used to this day.

                    <strong>Mary Lucy Cartwright </strong>is the grandmother of modern data science. Cartwright came from a wealthy family. She was educated at the finest schools, including Leamington High School in England, where a female mathematics teacher took a special interest in her. Cartwright then went on to study at St. Hugh’s College at Oxford University to study mathematics, but found herself pushed out of lectures, which she needed to graduate, by men returning from World War I. She half considered giving up and majoring in history instead, but she decided that math was the better path. She caught a lucky break at a party, where a professor suggested she attend some evening classes with a geometry professor, Godfrey H. Harding. That propelled her on her way to a degree in mathematics.
