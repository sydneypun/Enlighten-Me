            <h5> BLM post, September 4, 2020 </h5>

            <p> "To say that Black lives matter is not to say that other 
            lives do not; indeed, it is quite the reverse—it is to recognize 
            that all lives do matter, and to acknowledge that African Americans 
            are often targeted unfairly (witness the number of African Americans 
            accosted daily for no reason other than walking through a White 
            neighborhood—including some, like young Trayvon Martin, who lost their 
            lives) and that our society is not yet so advanced as to have become 
            truly color blind."

        <p>As stated by Bernie Sanders in his tweet on June 10, 2020, "Medical 
            workers trying to save lives have gone momths without adequate masks, 
        gloves, and gowns". On the other hand, police officers are given larger
        budgets for protective gear.  </p>
